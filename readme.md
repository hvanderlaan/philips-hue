# Philips Hue
Philips hue combines brilliant LED light with intuitive technology. Then puts it in the palm of your hand.

Together, the bulbs, the bridge and the app will change the way you use light. Forever. Experiment with shades of white, from invigorating blue/white to cozy yellow/white. Or play with all the colours in the spectrum.

hue can wake you up. Help protect your home. Relive your favourite memories. Improve your mood. Even keep you informed about the weather.

Not just stunning, hue is smart too. And itâ€™s tailored for you.
